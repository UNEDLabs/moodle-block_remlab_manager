1. Content
==========

This plugin lets users to manage the remote labs that can be later accessed using the Java or Javascript applications
created with Easy Java/Javascript Simulations (EJS) and which are added to a Moodle course by means of the ejsapp module.

The Java applets or the Javascript applications should have been created with version 5.1 (build 20150613 or later) of
EJS to work properly.

This plugin supports (but does not require) the use of SARLAB for managing the connection to the remote labs.
